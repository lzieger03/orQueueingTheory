echo "🔍 Validation Checklist:"
echo "1. ✅ AI agent creation race condition fixed"
echo "2. ✅ enableAI function creates agent immediately"
echo "3. ✅ Start Learning button handler improved"
echo "4. ✅ Q-Learning agent methods verified"
echo "5. ✅ AIAdvisor component integration confirmed"

echo "📋 Manual Testing Steps:"
echo "1. Open http://localhost:5174 in your browser"
echo "2. Add checkout stations to the layout (drag from sidebar)"
echo "3. Click the Brain icon (🧠) to open AI Advisor"
echo "4. Switch to the 'Learning' tab"
echo "5. Click the green 'Start Learning' button"
echo "6. Verify that the following metrics update:"
echo "   - Episodes: should increment from 0"
echo "   - Exploration Rate: should decrease from 30%"
echo "   - States Learned: should increase"
echo "   - Actions Evaluated: should increase"
echo "   - Learning Progress: should advance from 0% to 100%"

echo "🎯 Expected Behavior:"
echo "- Button changes from 'Start Learning' to 'Stop Learning'"
echo "- Learning progress bar advances over ~10 seconds"
echo "- Episodes counter increments to 1000"
echo "- Exploration rate decreases from 0.3 to minimum (0.01)"
echo "- Q-table statistics show learned states and actions"

echo "🐛 If Learning Doesn't Start:"
echo "1. Check browser console for errors"
echo "2. Ensure at least one checkout station is placed"
echo "3. Verify AI Advisor loads without errors"
echo "4. Check that Start Learning button is clickable"

echo ""
echo "✅ Fix Summary:"
echo "Fixed race condition where AI agent wasn't created before startLearning() was called."
echo "Solution: Create AI agent immediately in enableAI() function."
