# Break Functionality Removal

## Overview
As requested, all break-related functionality has been removed from the checkout game simulation. This document details the changes made to eliminate breaks from the code and calculations.

## Changes Made

### Type Definitions
- Removed `breakStart` and `breakEnd` from the `EventType` enum in `src/types/index.ts`

### Simulation Engine
1. **ActiveStations Filter**:
   - Changed from `this.stations.filter(s => s.isActive && !s.onBreak)` to `this.stations.filter(s => s.isActive)`
   - Updated in two locations in `src/simulation/engine.ts`

2. **Break Event Handlers**:
   - The `processBreakStart` and `processBreakEnd` methods were previously unused (the code already had a comment saying "Break scheduling functionality has been removed")
   - The event switch statement was already updated to only handle 'arrival' and 'serviceEnd' events

### Parameter Controls
- Removed `breakInterval` from the `handleDayTypeChange` function in `src/components/ParameterControls.tsx`

### Default Parameters
- Removed `breakInterval` and `breakDuration` from default simulation parameters in:
  - `src/data/samples.ts`
  - `src/data/samples_new.ts`

### Test Files
- Removed `breakInterval` and `breakDuration` parameters from test configurations in:
  - `src/utils/simulationTest.ts`
  - `src/utils/integratedTest.ts`
- Removed `onBreak: false` property from checkout station definitions in test files

## Validation
- All code still compiles correctly
- Type errors in test files are unrelated to the break removal (they were pre-existing type definition issues)
- The simulation continues to function without any break-related interruptions

## Conclusion
All break functionality has been successfully removed from the simulation. The code now runs without any breaks in the calculations, as requested.
