# Bug Fixes for Single-Line Queue Implementation

## Build Errors Fixed

When running `npm run build`, several TypeScript errors were identified and fixed:

### 1. Missing Package Dependency
**Error**: Cannot find module 'framer-motion' or its corresponding type declarations.
**Fix**: Installed the missing package with `npm install framer-motion`.

### 2. Unused Import
**Error**: 'GameUtils' is declared but its value is never read in MainQueueVisualizer.tsx.
**Fix**: Removed the unused import.

### 3. Unused Function
**Error**: 'findBestStation' is declared but its value is never read in engine.ts.
**Fix**: Removed the unused function as it's no longer needed in the single-queue implementation.

### 4. Duplicate Function Implementation
**Error**: Duplicate function implementation for `calculateQueuePositions` in gameUtils.ts.
**Fix**: Combined both implementations into a single, improved function that:
   - Takes a maxVisible parameter to limit queue visualization 
   - Uses better spacing for customer positions
   - Properly centers customers in the queue visually
   - Maintains compatibility with both usages in the codebase

## Functionality Improvements

In addition to fixing the build errors, we made some improvements to the queue visualization:

1. **Better Customer Spacing**: Increased the spacing between customers in the queue for better visual clarity
2. **Proper Horizontal Centering**: Adjusted customer positions to be properly centered relative to their stations
3. **Limited Queue Visualization**: Implemented proper maxVisible parameter usage to prevent overly long queue visualizations

These changes ensure the visual representation of queues remains performant and clear, even with many customers.

## Impact on Single-Line Queue Implementation

These fixes were necessary to ensure the single-line queue implementation works correctly and can be built for production. The implementation now:

- Uses Framer Motion for smooth customer animations in the main queue
- Has a cleaner codebase without unused code
- Properly visualizes both individual station queues and the main centralized queue
- Maintains compatibility with the existing station-based queue visualization
