# Chart Rendering Fixes - SimulationDashboard

## Overview
Fixed rendering issues with all four charts in the SimulationDashboard component that were preventing proper data visualization.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ResponsiveContainer Sizing
**Problem**: Charts were not rendering due to improper ResponsiveContainer sizing
**Solution**: 
- Changed from `width="100%" height="100%"` to `width="99%" height={220}`
- Added explicit parent container sizing with `h-[230px]` wrapper
- Used `debounce={50}` to improve performance

### 2. Data Type Conversion
**Problem**: Chart data contained mixed string/number types causing rendering failures
**Solution**:
- Added explicit `Number()` conversion for all data points in `.map()` functions
- Applied to time, waitTime, throughput, utilization, queueLength, and customers fields
- Ensured fallback values (|| 0) for missing data

### 3. Animation Issues
**Problem**: Recharts animations were causing rendering problems
**Solution**:
- Set `isAnimationActive={false}` on all Line and Bar components
- Removed problematic transition effects that interfered with chart updates

### 4. Chart-Specific Fixes

#### Wait Time Trend Chart
- Fixed time data conversion from timestamp to minutes
- Improved Y-axis with proper decimal handling
- Enhanced tooltip formatting for wait time display

#### Throughput Trend Chart
- Fixed throughput data type conversion
- Improved Y-axis for integer display of customers/hour
- Enhanced tooltip with proper unit formatting

#### Station Utilization Chart
- Fixed bar chart data mapping for station names and utilization
- Improved X-axis label rotation and spacing
- Enhanced tooltip with percentage formatting

#### System Overview Chart
- Fixed dual-line chart for utilization and queue length
- Improved Y-axis labeling from "Values" to "Metrics"
- Enhanced tooltip formatter for both percentage and count data

## Technical Implementation

### ResponsiveContainer Pattern
```tsx
<div className="w-full h-[230px]">
  <ResponsiveContainer width="99%" height={220} debounce={50}>
    <LineChart data={data.map(d => ({
      ...d,
      fieldName: Number(d.fieldName)
    }))}>
      {/* Chart configuration */}
    </LineChart>
  </ResponsiveContainer>
</div>
```

### Data Conversion Pattern
```tsx
const chartData = timeSeriesData.map(d => ({
  ...d,
  time: Number(d.time),
  value: Number(d.value)
}));
```

### Error Handling Pattern
```tsx
{hasData ? (
  <ResponsiveContainer>
    {/* Chart */}
  </ResponsiveContainer>
) : (
  <div className="flex items-center justify-center h-full w-full">
    <p className="text-gray-400 italic">Waiting for simulation data...</p>
  </div>
)}
```

## Verification
- ✅ All four charts render correctly
- ✅ No console errors during chart updates
- ✅ Proper responsive behavior
- ✅ Smooth data updates during simulation
- ✅ Fallback states for empty data

## Future Considerations
1. Monitor chart performance during long simulation runs
2. Consider implementing chart data throttling for high-frequency updates
3. Add chart export functionality if needed
4. Consider adding zoom/pan capabilities for detailed analysis

## Dependencies
- recharts: ^2.8.0
- React: ^18.2.0
- TypeScript: ^5.0.0
