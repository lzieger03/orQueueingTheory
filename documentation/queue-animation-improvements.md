# Queue Animation and Visibility Improvements

This document details the improvements made to the main queue visualizer and customer animations in the Checkout Layout Game.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Repositioned Main Queue Visualizer
- Moved the main queue from the top quarter of the PlayBoard to the bottom
- Updated position CSS from `top-1/4` to `bottom-8` for better visibility
- Made the queue consistently visible during simulation
- Improved z-indexing from `z-20` to `z-30` to ensure the queue appears above other elements
- Ensured the queue remains properly visible at all screen sizes and layouts

### 2. Enhanced Customer Animations at Slow Speeds
- Created specialized animation behavior for ultra-slow speeds (0.1x and 0.25x)
- Added an `ultra-slow-motion` class specifically for 0.1x speed with longer 15s animation duration
- Enhanced the `slow-motion-queue` CSS class that gets applied conditionally based on simulation speed
- Implemented the `slowQueueFlow` animation with more detailed keyframes for smoother movement
- Added CSS custom properties (`--move-x`, `--move-y`) for position transitions to checkouts
- Created a `moveToCheckout` animation for customer movement to checkout stations
- Adjusted transition times and animation durations to be proportional to simulation speed

### 3. Speed-sensitive Animation Timing
- Made all animation durations responsive to the current simulation speed
- Added utility classes (`speed-0-1x`, `speed-0-25x`, etc.) for consistent animation speed control
- Calculated transition time and animation time based on simulation speed:
  ```typescript
  const animationTime = Math.max(0.5, 2.5 / (simulationSpeed || 1));
  const transitionTime = Math.max(0.8, 3.0 / (simulationSpeed || 1));
  ```

### 4. Visual Enhancements for Slow Motion
- Added enhanced box-shadow effects that pulse during slow motion animations
- Improved the scaling effect to make customer movements more noticeable at slow speeds
- Ensured animations remain smooth by using the `will-change` CSS property for better performance

## Technical Implementation Details

### MainQueueVisualizer Component
The updates to the MainQueueVisualizer component included:

1. Repositioning the container:
   ```jsx
   <div className="absolute left-1/2 bottom-8 transform -translate-x-1/2 z-30">
   ```

2. Adding speed-specific CSS classes:
   ```jsx
   className={`customer-icon absolute w-4 h-4 rounded-full customer-waiting ${
     customer.prefersSelfCheckout ? 'bg-green-500' : 'bg-blue-500'
   } ${simulationSpeed <= 0.1 ? 'ultra-slow-motion' : simulationSpeed <= 0.25 ? 'slow-motion-queue' : ''}`}
   ```

3. Implementing dynamic animation timing and position variables:
   ```jsx
   style={{ 
     // ...other styles
     transition: `all ${transitionTime}s ease`,
     animationDuration: `${animationTime * 3}s`,
     '--move-x': '0px',
     '--move-y': '0px'
   }}
   ```

### CSS Animation Enhancements
Added new animation keyframes and utility classes:

1. Enhanced animations for different speed levels:
   
   Slow motion animation for 0.25x speed:
   ```css
   @keyframes slowQueueFlow {
     0% { transform: translateY(0) scale(1); box-shadow: 0 0 5px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5); }
     25% { transform: translateY(-2px) scale(1.03); box-shadow: 0 0 8px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.6); }
     50% { transform: translateY(-4px) scale(1.06); box-shadow: 0 0 12px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8); }
     75% { transform: translateY(-2px) scale(1.03); box-shadow: 0 0 8px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.6); }
     100% { transform: translateY(0) scale(1); box-shadow: 0 0 5px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5); }
   }
   ```
   
   Animation for customer movement to checkout stations:
   ```css
   @keyframes moveToCheckout {
     0% { opacity: 1; transform: translate(0, 0) scale(1); }
     50% { opacity: 0.8; transform: translate(var(--move-x), var(--move-y)) scale(1.1); }
     100% { opacity: 0.6; transform: translate(var(--move-x), var(--move-y)) scale(1); }
   }
   ```
   
   Ultra-slow motion class for 0.1x speed:
   ```css
   .ultra-slow-motion {
     animation-duration: 15s !important;
     transition-duration: 10s !important;
   }
   ```
   ```

2. Speed-specific utility classes:
   ```css
   .speed-0-1x { animation-duration: 10s !important; transition-duration: 10s !important; }
   .speed-0-25x { animation-duration: 4s !important; transition-duration: 4s !important; }
   /* and so on... */
   ```

## Testing

These changes have been tested with various simulation speeds:
- Ultra-slow (0.1x): Customers move very slowly with enhanced animations
- Slow (0.25x): Shows detailed customer movements with proper timing
- Normal (1.0x): Standard animation speed
- Fast (2x-10x): Customers move quickly with shorter animation durations

## Additional Animation Improvements

### Customer Movement to Checkout Counters
- Added enhanced animations for customers moving to checkout counters
- Created special CSS classes for ultra-slow speeds:
  - `customer-moving-slow` for 0.25x speed
  - `customer-moving-ultra-slow` for 0.1x speed
- Implemented multi-step keyframe animations via `customerMoveEnhanced` 
- Added CSS custom properties (`--move-x`, `--move-y`) for dynamic path calculation
- Enhanced visual feedback with glowing effects at slow speeds

### Visual Enhancements
- Added more pronounced glow effects for customer icons at slow speeds
- Increased z-index (z-40) for customers in motion to ensure visibility
- Implemented smoother easing functions for natural movement
- Added step-by-step animation with 7 keyframes for detailed visualization

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements:
- Implement velocity-based animations for more natural movement
- Add hover effects to display customer details during slow motion
- Consider particle effects or trails for customer movement at various speeds
- Add interactive tooltips showing customer path at ultra-slow speeds
