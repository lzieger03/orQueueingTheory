# Main Queue Visualization Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the improvements made to the Main Queue Visualizer in the Checkout Layout Game. The main queue has been repositioned and animations have been enhanced, particularly at slower simulation speeds.

## Positioning Changes
The main queue visualizer has been moved from the middle of the play area to the bottom of the screen. This provides several benefits:

1. **Better Visibility**: The queue is now less likely to be obscured by checkout stations
2. **Improved Spatial Organization**: Clearly separates the customer entry point from the queue
3. **More Logical Flow**: Better represents the natural flow of customers from entrance to queue to checkout

## Animation Enhancements
Customer animations in the queue have been significantly improved, particularly at slower simulation speeds:

### Standard Speed (1.0x)
- Basic animation cycle with subtle movement
- Transition timing appropriately set to show movement between queue positions

### Slow Speed (0.5x)
- Longer animation duration
- Smoother transitions between positions
- Animation speed scaled proportionally to simulation speed

### Ultra-Slow Speeds (0.1x and 0.25x)
- Special animation class `slow-motion-queue` applied
- Enhanced keyframe animation with more detailed movement
- Visual effects (scaling and shadow changes) to make movement more noticeable
- Extended animation duration (up to 8 seconds per cycle)

## Implementation Details

### MainQueueVisualizer Component
The component now:
1. Positions itself at the bottom of the play area
2. Applies appropriate animation classes based on simulation speed
3. Calculates transition and animation timings dynamically

### CSS Enhancements
Two distinct animations are now used:
1. **queueFlow**: Standard animation for normal speeds
2. **slowQueueFlow**: Enhanced animation for ultra-slow speeds with additional visual feedback

## Technical Notes
- Animation durations are calculated using `Math.max(3, 3 / Math.min(simulationSpeed, 1))s` to ensure appropriate speed
- Transitions between queue positions use `transition: all ${Math.max(0.5, 1.5 / simulationSpeed)}s ease` to scale with simulation speed
- The `slow-motion-queue` class is conditionally applied when `simulationSpeed <= 0.25`

## Future Improvements
- Implement direction indicators for customer movement in the queue
- Add hover effects to display customer information (wait time, items, etc.)
- Consider alternative queue visualization layouts for different store types
