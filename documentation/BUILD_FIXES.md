# TypeScript Build Fixes

## Overview
This document details the fixes made to address TypeScript errors that occurred during the build process after removing break functionality from the codebase.

## Issue
After removing break-related code from the main simulation engine, several TypeScript errors remained during build:

```
src/debug/testCustomers.ts:14:5 - error TS2353: Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'onBreak' does not exist in type 'CheckoutStation'.
src/utils/integratedTest.ts:29:5 - error TS2353: Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'onBreak' does not exist in type 'CheckoutStation'.
src/utils/integratedTest.ts:41:5 - error TS2353: Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'onBreak' does not exist in type 'CheckoutStation'.
src/utils/operationsResearchMath.ts:166:66 - error TS2339: Property 'onBreak' does not exist on type 'CheckoutStation'.
```

These errors occurred because while we removed `onBreak` from the `CheckoutStation` interface, there were still references to this property in several utility and test files.

## Files Fixed

1. **src/debug/testCustomers.ts**
   - Removed `onBreak: false` from the test station object

2. **src/utils/operationsResearchMath.ts**
   - Changed `stations.filter(s => s.isActive && !s.onBreak)` to `stations.filter(s => s.isActive)`

3. **src/utils/integratedTest.ts**
   - Removed `onBreak: false` from two station definitions:
     - 'regular_2' station object
     - 'kiosk_1' station object

## Verification
After making these changes, the build process completed successfully with no TypeScript errors.

## Notes
- These files weren't caught in our initial refactoring because they were utility and debug files not used in the main simulation path
- The operationsResearchMath.ts file had a dependency on the onBreak property for calculating station utilization that needed to be updated

## Future Considerations
When making interface changes, it's important to run a full build early to catch all references to changed properties across the entire codebase, including utility and test files.
